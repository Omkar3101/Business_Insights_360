## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to provide a 360-degree view of AtliQ Hardware's business operations. The goal was to replace outdated static reports with a dynamic, interactive solution that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain departments.

The project addresses the business problem of significant losses faced by AtliQ Hardware due to a lack of timely and accessible data insights.
