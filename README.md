**AtliQ Hardware BI Project**

AtliQ Hardware is one of the fastest-growing companies in the electronics market. But their growth journey was built on **gut feelings and assumptions**, which led to costly mistakes—like a failed expansion into Latin America.

That’s when they realized: **data is not optional, it’s essential.**

This project demonstrates how I, as a **Data Analyst**, built an **end-to-end BI solution** to transform AtliQ’s raw data into actionable insights across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive reporting**.

**🟡 Problem Statement**

- AtliQ relied heavily on assumptions for business expansion.
- The Latin America expansion led to major losses due to lack of data-backed decisions.
- Fierce competition (like DALL·E) was already leveraging analytics.
- Leadership needed a **data-driven system** to compete and grow sustainably.
